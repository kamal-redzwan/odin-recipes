    This baked chicken and vegetable dish is delicious. I got in from work one
    night and wanted something a little lighter. I used frozen chicken breasts
    and fresh veggies. I added the spices at random, and it turned out really
    good, I thought. There were no complaints from the others either.

  <ul>
    Ingredients:
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>8 carrots, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
    <li>8 stalks celery, chopped</li>
    <li>8 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>4 green bell peppers, sliced</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>4 pinches freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    Directions:
    <li>Steps 1</li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Steps 2</li>
    <p>
      Arrange chicken breasts on a baking sheet; spread carrots, celery, green
      onion, bell pepper, and parsley around chicken. Drizzle olive oil over
      chicken and vegetables; season with Italian seasoning, chili powder, lemon
      pepper, salt, and black pepper.
    </p>
    <li>Steps 3</li>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center
      and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
      inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
      C).
