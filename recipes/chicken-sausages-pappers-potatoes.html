  <ul>
    Ingredients:
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>4 large links hot Italian sausage</li>
    <li>6 bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
    <li>½ pound assorted sweet peppers, seeded</li>
    <li>4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li>
    <li>1 small red onion, sliced</li>
    <li>½ medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    Directions:
    <li>Steps 1</li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Steps 2</li>
    <p>
      Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausage links and
      cook until browned and fat begins to render, about 3 minutes per side.
      While they cook, lightly pierce sausages in several places with the tip of
      a sharp knife to release fats and juices. Remove from the heat and place
      on a cutting board to cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <li>Steps 3</li>
    <p>
      Cut cooled sausages into 2-inch slices; return to the skillet along with
      any accumulated juices from the cutting board.
    </p>
    <li>Steps 4</li>
    <p>
      Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh.
      Halve or quarter any large peppers.
    </p>
    <li>Steps 5</li>
    <p>
      Place chicken and peppers into a large mixing bowl with onions, sausage
      and juices, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1
      tablespoon oil and mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in
      oil, 3 to 4 minutes.
    </p>
    <li>Steps 6</li>
    <p>
      Transfer mixture to a large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space chicken
      thighs with the skin facing up and position potatoes near the top.
    </p>
    <li>Steps 7</li>
    <p>
      Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything
      is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
      the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped
      fresh Italian parsley.
